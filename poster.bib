                 software project for the analysis of data from diffusion
                 magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an
                 application of MRI that can be used to measure structural
                 features of brain white matter. Many methods have been
                 developed to use dMRI data to model the local configuration of
                 white matter nerve fiber bundles and infer the trajectory of
                 bundles connecting different parts of the brain. Dipy gathers
                 implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including:
                 diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion
                 distributions in individual voxels; fiber tractography and
                 fiber track post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy
                 aims to provide transparent implementations for all the
                 different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming
                 interface. We have implemented classical signal reconstruction
                 techniques, such as the diffusion tensor model and
                 deterministic fiber tractography. In addition, cutting edge
                 novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such as
                 constrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum
                 imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as methods for
                 probabilistic tracking and original methods for tractography
                 clustering. Many additional utility functions are provided to
                 calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as
                 well as file-handling routines to assist in the development
                 and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many other
                 scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed by a
                 single research group. Rather, it is an open project that
                 encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
                 GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
                 Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of
                 contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions
                 in five countries and three continents, which is still

                   architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters,

                 detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying
                 spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important
                 component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will
                 aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as
                 frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD),
                 which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population.
                 Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method
                 (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of
                 diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations
                 necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful
                 evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard,
                 human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with
                 a related elastic method and with the standard ITK
                 implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method
                 compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when
                 the distance between the template brain and the target brain
                 is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by
                 algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects
                 with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows
                 that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements
                 are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements
                 gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with
                 cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and
                 making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients

                is transformed into an output image. Recent methods for such
                problems typically train feed-forward convolutional neural
                networks using a per-pixel loss between the output and
                ground-truth images. Parallel work has shown that high-quality
                images can be generated by defining and optimizing perceptual
                loss functions based on high-level features extracted from
                pretrained networks. We combine the benefits of both
                approaches, and propose the use of perceptual loss functions
                for training feed-forward networks for image transformation
                tasks. We show results on image style transfer, where a
                feed-forward network is trained to solve the optimization
                problem proposed by Gatys et al. in real-time. Compared to the
                optimization-based method, our network gives similar
                qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude faster. We
                also experiment with single-image super-resolution, where
                replacing a per-pixel loss with a perceptual loss gives
                visually pleasing results.",

                 communicate their results with reference to anatomical
                 regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group
                 analysis of functional and physiological data require
                 coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across
                 brain structures. It is well established that linear
                 registration of one brain to another is inadequate for
                 aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged
                 to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is
                 the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms
                 applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen
                 algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated
                 using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000
                 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were
                 performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART,
                 Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE,
                 SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms (``SPM2-type'' and
                 regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL
                 Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear
                 registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of
                 the most significant findings of this study is that the
                 relative performances of the registration methods under
                 comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of
                 subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap
                 measure. This is important because it suggests that the
                 findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are
                 labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols.
                 Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three
                 completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way
                 ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three
                 almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK,

                 age of the patient. Intraregional plots were also made of
